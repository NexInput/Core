# NexInput
You can connect the library immediately after starting the game, but if no controller is found, you need to unload the "NexInput" and connect it again after the menu is shown, so the user will have time to turn on the gamepad if it is off. When you press the exit from the game, you can use the "NexInputPowerOff" function to save the controller charge.

## Settings
The user must have the ability to turn off the gyroscope and RGB-LED in the game settings.

## Gyroscope
Gyroscope can expand and improve gaming experience.


Gyroscope can be used for more accurate aiming in shooters. Goal becomes easier and more convenient. Stick glance moves to the sample area, and the gyroscope in the target.

The gyroscope can be used to control a stationary machine gun, if the aiming gyro is disabled.

The gyroscope can be used to a car.

The gyroscope correction can also be activated only by pressing the left trigger (when aiming), this will allow you to use it not only for more accurate aiming, but also for different chips, such as flashlight reloading, weapon reloading, jumping and so on.

To centering the gyroscope, you can display an inscription about the need to hold the controller evenly for a couple of seconds while loading the game and make a button in the menu.

## RGB-LED
RGB-LED can add more atmosphere to the game.

RGB-LED can be used:
- To display the standard of living (red - danger, yellow - attention and green - everything is ok);
- For Ambilight. For example, you go in the game through the tunnel, and then the alarm is turned on, the game turns red and then the controller LED lights up and Ambilight occurs. Or the game uses a flashlight and when you turn on the flashlight, you can also turn on the RGB-LED. At night, it definitely adds to the atmosphere.
